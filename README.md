Emoji Detection
===============

This library will find all emoji in an input string and return information about each emoji character. It supports emoji with skin tone modifiers, as well as the composite emoji that are made up of multiple people.

Usage
-----

### Detect Emoji

```php
$input = "Hello 👍🏼 World 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦";
$emoji = Emoji\detect_emoji($input);

print_r($emoji);
```

The function returns an array with details about each emoji found in the string.

```
Array
(
  [0] => Array
    (
      [emoji] => 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦
      [short_name] => man-woman-boy-boy
      [num_points] => 7
      [points_hex] => Array
        (
          [0] => 1F468
          [1] => 200D
          [2] => 1F469
          [3] => 200D
          [4] => 1F466
          [5] => 200D
          [6] => 1F466
        )
      [hex_str] => 1F468-200D-1F469-200D-1F466-200D-1F466
      [skin_tone] =>
    )
  [1] => Array
    (
      [emoji] => 👍🏼
      [short_name] => +1
      [num_points] => 2
      [points_hex] => Array
        (
          [0] => 1F44D
          [1] => 1F3FC
        )

      [hex_str] => 1F44D-1F3FC
      [skin_tone] => skin-tone-3
    )
)
```

* `emoji` - The emoji sequence found, as the original byte sequence. You can output this to show the original emoji.
* `short_name` - The short name of the emoji, as defined by [Slack's emoji data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data).
* `num_points` - The number of unicode code points that this emoji is composed of.
* `points_hex` - An array of each unicode code point that makes up this emoji. These are returned as hex strings. This will also include "invisible" characters such as the ZWJ character and skin tone modifiers.
* `hex_str` - A list of all unicode code points in their hex form separated by hyphens. This string is present in the [Slack emoji data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data) array.
* `skin_tone` - If a skin tone modifier was used in the emoji, this field indicates which skin tone, since the `short_name` will not include the skin tone.


### Test if a string is a single emoji

Since simply counting the number of unicode characters in a string does not tell you how many visible emoji are in the string, determining whether a single character is an emoji is more involved. This function will return the emoji data only if the string contains a single emoji character, and false otherwise.

```php
$emoji = Emoji\is_single_emoji('👨‍👩‍👦‍👦');
print_r($emoji);
```

```
Array
(
    [emoji] => 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦
    [short_name] => man-woman-boy-boy
    [num_points] => 7
    [points_hex] => Array
        (
            [0] => 1F468
            [1] => 200D
            [2] => 1F469
            [3] => 200D
            [4] => 1F466
            [5] => 200D
            [6] => 1F466
        )

    [hex_str] => 1F468-200D-1F469-200D-1F466-200D-1F466
    [skin_tone] =>
)
```

```php
$emoji = Emoji\is_single_emoji('😻🐈');
// false
```
